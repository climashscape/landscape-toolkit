# Workflow: Terrain & Planting

This tutorial explains how to generate naturally undulating terrain and configure planting.

## 1. Terrain Generation

### Step 1: Prepare Elevation Data
*   **Input**: Contours (Curves) or Points.
*   **Component**: `Terrain`
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `Target Quad Count`: 2000 (Adjust based on site size).
    *   `Smooth`: True (To eliminate stair-step effects).

### Step 2: Subdivision & Sculpting
*   Convert the generated `QuadMesh` to SubD.
*   Use Rhino's Gumball to push/pull SubD control points to fine-tune terrain undulations.

## 2. Planting Scatter

### Step 1: Extract Planting Areas
*   Use `Plot Generator` to create plot meshes.
*   Or directly use the terrain surface generated by `Terrain`.

### Step 2: Define Scatter Rules
*   **Component**: `Scatter` (Implement yourself or use existing logic).
*   **Trees**: Use Poisson Disk Sampling to avoid overlapping trees.
    *   Spacing: 5m - 8m.
*   **Shrubs/Groundcover**: Use random sampling or noise textures to control density.

### Step 3: Instancing
*   Use Grasshopper's `Elefront` or native `Block` functions to instantiate plant blocks onto scatter points, keeping the model lightweight.
