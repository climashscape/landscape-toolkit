# Wooly Path Optimizer

**Category:** Landscape > Optimization
**Nickname:** WoolyPath

## 1. Introduction
Wooly Path Optimizer is a path optimization tool based on the **Physarum Polycephalum (Slime Mold)** bio-mimetic algorithm. It simulates the behavior of organisms foraging and establishing efficient transport networks in an environment, used to generate organic path systems that align with natural human flow patterns.

Unlike traditional "shortest path" algorithms, the paths generated by this component have organic forms, can adaptively avoid obstacles (future feature), and form a clear hierarchical structure.

## 2. Core Algorithm
This component runs an Agent-based simulation system:
1.  **Agents**: Thousands of virtual agents move randomly on the canvas.
2.  **Sensory**: Agents detect "Pheromone" concentration ahead via sensors.
3.  **Decision**: Agents tend to turn towards directions with higher pheromone concentration (positive feedback loop).
4.  **Deposition**: Agents leave pheromones on the paths they traverse.
5.  **Diffusion & Decay**: Pheromones diffuse to the surroundings and decay over time, simulating natural chemical signal propagation.

## 3. Input Parameters

| Name | Abbr. | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bounds** | B | Rectangle | - | Simulation boundary. Agents are confined within this area. |
| **Resolution** | Res | Integer | 100 | Grid resolution. Higher values yield finer paths but slower calculation. Recommended 100-300. |
| **AgentCount** | N | Integer | 1000 | Number of agents. More agents result in clearer paths and a denser network. |
| **SensorDistance** | SD | Number | 5.0 | Sensor detection distance. Determines how "far" agents can see. |
| **SensorAngle** | SA | Number | 45° (π/4) | Angle of sensors relative to the forward direction. |
| **TurnAngle** | TA | Number | 45° (π/4) | Maximum turn angle of agents. |
| **Reset** | R | Boolean | False | Resets simulation state (clears canvas and agent positions). |
| **Run** | Run | Boolean | False | Activates simulation. When set to True, simulation runs frame by frame. |

## 4. Output Parameters

| Name | Abbr. | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TrailMap** | M | Mesh | Visualization mesh of the pheromone map. Whiter colors indicate more frequently traversed paths. |
| **Agents** | A | Point (List) | Real-time positions of all agents (for particle effect display). |
| **Iteration** | I | Integer | Current simulation step count. |

## 5. Tips
*   **Resolution Settings**: Use low resolution (50-100) for initial testing, and increase to 200+ for final output.
*   **Parameter Tuning**: 
    *   Increasing `SensorDistance` produces longer, straighter paths.
    *   Decreasing `TurnAngle` results in smoother paths.
*   **Workflow**: Use in conjunction with the `Trace` component (under development) to convert the TrailMap into vector curves, which can then be input into `Quad Road Network` to generate solid road networks.
