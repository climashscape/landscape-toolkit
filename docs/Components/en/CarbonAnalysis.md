# Carbon Analysis

**Carbon Analysis** component estimates the carbon sequestration benefits of a landscape design.

## Inputs
*   **TreePoints (T)**: List of points representing trees.
*   **GreenAreas (A)**: List of meshes/surfaces representing shrubs or lawns.
*   **TreeFactor (TF)**: Annual carbon sequestration per tree (kg/year), Default: 22.0.
*   **AreaFactor (AF)**: Annual carbon sequestration per unit area of green space (kg/m2/year), Default: 1.5.

## Outputs
*   **TotalCarbon (C)**: Total carbon sequestration (kg/year).
*   **Report (R)**: Detailed calculation report (Text).

## Algorithm Basis
Based on average carbon sequestration capabilities of common landscape plants.
